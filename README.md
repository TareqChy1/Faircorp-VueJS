## Context

The goal of the 2022 Web Programing project is to implement a fully functional Smart Building management system (especially building, rooms, windows and heaters controllers).\
The project is composed of a [Java SpringBoot Backend server]() and a [VueJS Frontend server](https://github.com/TareqChy1/Faircorp-VueJS) interacting together. 


## Project setup or access via the [Deployed GitHub Page](https://github.com/TareqChy1/Faircorp-VueJS)
Install all the dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

We locally run our Faircorp_Backend project in [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and Faircorp_Frontend project in [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) 

NB : The frontend is supposed to work with the Spring Backend deployed on Clever-Cloud. If not or if anyone want to run the backend locally, anyone can configure the API's hostname in [./src/config.js](./src/config.js)

npm run build
